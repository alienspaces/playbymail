Game content, communication, and visuals are delivered by email or physical mail. Turn processing and game state updates are automated; players submit turns by email or by returning forms and puzzles through the mail, with human review only when needed.

The platform supports the full spectrum of turn-based game types: RPG, strategy, wargames, adventure, sports, diplomacy, 4X, economic simulations, and more. Designers get flexible tools to create and publish games, storylines, maps, and puzzles, optimized for both digital and print delivery. Players get diverse turn-based experiences—from narrative adventures to complex strategic campaigns—whether they prefer email or physical mail.

Privacy, security, age-appropriateness, and inclusivity are core principles, with support for parental controls and accessibility.

AI is integrated where appropriate, always subject to human review for narrative and safety.
