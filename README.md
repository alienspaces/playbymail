<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033-->

A platform to revitalize play-by-mail (PBM) games for all ages, supporting a wide variety of genres (RPG, strategy, adventure, sports, and more).

All game content, communication, and visuals are delivered via printed materials mailed to players, with automated turn processing and game state updates.

Players return completed forms and puzzles by mail for processing, with human review only when needed.

Game writers have tools to create, manage, and publish new games, storylines, maps, and puzzles, all optimized for print.

Privacy, security, age-appropriateness, and inclusivity are core principles, with support for parental controls and accessibility.

AI is integrated where appropriate, always subject to human review for narrative and safety.

The system is designed for flexibility, supporting diverse PBM game types and print-and-mail workflows.
