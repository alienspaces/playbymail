All game content, communication, and visuals are delivered via printed materials mailed to players, with automated turn processing and game state updates.

Players return completed forms and puzzles by mail for processing, with human review only when needed.

The platform is being built to support the full spectrum of classic and modern play-by-mail game types. For designers, this means flexible tools to create adventure games, strategy and wargames, fantasy empire-building campaigns, space 4X and science-fiction strategy games, diplomacy and political negotiation games, hybrid strategy/RPG formats, sports simulations, economic simulations, and more. For players, this translates to diverse gaming experiences—from narrative-driven adventures to complex strategic campaigns—all delivered through the tactile experience of physical mail.

Game writers have tools to create, manage, and publish new games, storylines, maps, and puzzles, all optimized for print.

Privacy, security, age-appropriateness, and inclusivity are core principles, with support for parental controls and accessibility.

AI is integrated where appropriate, always subject to human review for narrative and safety.

The system is designed for flexibility, supporting diverse PBM game types and print-and-mail workflows.
