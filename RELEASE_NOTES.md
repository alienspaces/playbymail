**Theme**: OCR Integration & Production Deployment

### 🎯 Major Features

**Turn Sheet Scanning & OCR**
- Complete turn sheet scanning with Tesseract OCR integration
- Location choice processor with intelligent pattern matching
- Base processor architecture for extensible turn sheet types
- Handles OCR artifacts (Q/, O/, Sf patterns, cents symbol, checkboxes)
- Priority-based pattern matching with counting heuristics

**Data Structures & PDF Generation**
- Turn sheet data structures with type-safe structs
- Join game turn sheet structure and template
- Fixed footer layout for consistent turn sheet code positioning
- PDF layout optimizations and template improvements

### 🚀 Infrastructure & Deployment

**Heroku & CI/CD**
- Tesseract OCR dependencies for Heroku buildpacks
- Fixed OCR initialization failures in CI/CD pipelines
- Simplified Aptfile and added dedicated Tesseract buildpack
- OCR dependencies added to GitHub Actions
- Enhanced debugging and CI triggers

### 🧪 Testing Infrastructure

**Test Framework**
- Restructured harness for realistic turn testing
- Comprehensive test framework for turn sheet generation and scanning
- Real test image assets for OCR validation
- Created testing guide (TESTING.md) with best practices

### 🎨 User Interface

**Frontend Updates**
- Removed hero decoration from home page
- Added support email (support@playbymail.games) to footer

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

**Code Quality**
- Refactored scanning and generating architecture
- Improved validation, error handling, and code organization
- Code formatting cleanup across codebase

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed OCR text cleaning and regex patterns
- Fixed Heroku build dependencies and Tesseract OCR initialization
- Fixed import cycles and test data handling
