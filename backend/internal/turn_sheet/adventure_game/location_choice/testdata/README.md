# Location Choice Test Data

This directory contains test fixtures for location choice turn sheet testing.

## Generated PDF

- `location_choice_test_sheet.pdf` - Generated PDF for physical testing (105KB)

## Test Images

When OCR scanning is implemented, add test images here:

- `location_choice_filled.jpg` - Sample scanned turn sheet image (to be added)
- `valid_location_choice.png` - Clean scan with all fields filled correctly
- `poor_quality_scan.png` - Low quality scan to test error handling
- `missing_code_scan.png` - Scan with missing turn sheet code
- `multiple_choices.png` - Scan with multiple location selections

## Expected Results

Add JSON files with expected scan results:

- `valid_location_choice.json` - Expected output for valid scan
- `multiple_choices.json` - Expected output for multiple choice scan

## PDF Generation

The test PDF is generated by running:
```bash
cd backend
SAVE_PDF_FOR_TESTING=true go test -v -run TestGenerateLocationChoicePDF ./internal/turn_sheet/adventure_game/location_choice/
```

## Usage

Test images should be:
- PNG or JPEG format
- Actual scanned turn sheets or realistic simulations
- Named descriptively to indicate what scenario they test

## Adding Test Images

When adding new test images:

1. Print the generated PDF
2. Fill out the turn sheet by hand
3. Take a high-quality photo of the completed sheet
4. Save as `location_choice_filled.jpg` in this directory
5. Update the corresponding expected result JSON file
